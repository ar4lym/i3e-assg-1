How the game runs & what is it about:
Player has to go around the map retrieving dinosaurs that has escaped their cages, before they escape forever... 

Player has to retrieve 15 dinosaurs, manuvaring things such as hazard point and get through closed door, which can only be opened through obtaining a key card which the player has to find around the map.
when health gets low, player can be comforted by the ducks that lost their home to the crocodiles, resulting in their hp increasing.

instead of pushing the boxes to get to the keycaard that unlocks the door, player can climb up the cage and jump to the platform.
